# COVID-19 Lockdown Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes the effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures on various factors such as confirmed cases, vaccination rates, and public health responses. The analysis is conducted using Python, with the data sourced from multiple reliable datasets.

## Project Overview

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand how different lockdown measures impacted COVID-19 spread and vaccination efforts across different regions. By analyzing correlations and patterns, this project aims to draw insights into the effectiveness of public health policies during the pandemic.

## Data Sources

- COVID-19 Cases: Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- Vaccination Rates: Information on people vaccinated and fully vaccinated.
- Government Measures: Data on school closings, workplace closings, and cancellation of public events.

## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the datasets to handle missing values, filter relevant columns, and ensure consistency across different datasets.
2. Correlation Analysis: Calculating correlation coefficients to identify relationships between various factors.
3. Visualization: Using heatmaps and other visualization tools to represent data correlations and trends effectively.

## Key Findings

1. Inverse Correlation: Confirmed COVID-19 cases showed an inverse relationship with most of the government measures except vaccination rates. This indicates that while measures were in place, they might not have been sufficient to curtail the spread of the virus.
2. Effectiveness of Measures: Strict lockdown measures like school and workplace closures, along with event cancellations, played a crucial role in reducing the spread of the virus.

## Repository Structure

- Notebook: The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes all the code and output for the project.
- Data: Links or references to the datasets used (note that these should be downloaded separately due to size constraints).
- Visualizations: Contains plots and heatmaps generated during the analysis.
